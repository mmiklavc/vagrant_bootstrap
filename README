Vagrant setup for bootstrapping an HDP installation

First I recommend that you install Sahara plugin for Vagrant - take a snapshot once you've configured HDP. Restarting the servers ends up causing problems with HDFS and you'll have to manually reformat.
vagrant plugin install sahara

Sets up artifacts
----------
.bashrc
.vimrc
.ssh - you will need to add this to the root Vagrant project folder yourself
bootstrap.sh - sets up various tools necessary for HDP. See script for more details.
hosts - modify to your preference
